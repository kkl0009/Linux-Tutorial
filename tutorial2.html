<h1>Linux Tutorial Two </h1>

<h2 class="subheader">2.1 Creating and Editing Files</h2>
<h3>touch</h3>
<p>In working with the Linux terminal, it is likely that you will need to create files.</p> 
<p>This can be accomplished in multiple 
  ways (some more of which will be discussed later), but perhaps the most straightforward way is to use the touch command.</p>
<p> This command is used to update the modification date of a file in a directory, or to create a file with the given name if
  it does not already exist. </p>
<p>Below an example of a file created with the touch command is given in the screenshot:</p>
<p align="center"><img class="screenshot" src="P2/touch.png" alt="Linux Terminal - using the touch command" /> </p>
<h3>vim</h3>
<p>Linux supports the use of all sorts of different text editors, but this tutorial will focus on the VIM text editor.</p>
<p>It was designed as an improvement to the vi (visual) editor (vim = vi improved), and can be used in the terminal.</p> 
<p>See the screenshot below for an example of its use:</p>
<p align="center"><img class="screenshot" src="P2/vim.png" alt="Linux Terminal - using the vim command" /> </p>
<p>Upon running the above command, you will see an interface that looks like the screenshot below:</p>
<p align="center"><img class="screenshot" src="P2/vim-editor.png" alt="Linux Terminal - the editor for the vim text editor"  /> </p>
<p>In order to write to the file you have opened in the editor, press the [<strong>i</strong>] key on the keyboard. You should see "INSERT" appear at
  bottom of the terminal.
</p>
<p>When you have finished writing to the file, press the [<strong>esc</strong>] key to exit INSERT mode. Then press the colon [<strong>:</strong>] key, the [<strong>w</strong>] key
  (for write/save), the [<strong>q</strong>] key (to quit), and exclamation point [<strong>!</strong>], followed by the [<strong>enter</strong>] key to exit the file, saving all the changes.</p>
  <p>The vim text editor offers several other features, and you are encouraged to explore the features on your own.
</p>
<p>Seen below is the creation of a new file called longFile containing the numbers 1-50. This file will be used later in the tutorial.</p>
<p align="center"><img class="screenshot" src="P2/vim-long.png" alt="Linux Terminal - the creation of longFile" /> </p>

<h2 class="subheader">2.2 Displaying the contents of a file on the screen </h2>
<h3>clear (clear screen)</h3>
<p>Before you start the next section, you may like to clear the terminal window 
  of the previous commands so the output of the following commands can be clearly 
  understood. </p>
<p> At the prompt, type </p>
<p class="cli"> $ clear </p>
<p> This will clear all text and leave you with the $ prompt at the top of the 
  window. </p>
<p align="center"><img class="screenshot" src="P2/clear.png" alt="Linux Terminal - using the clear command" /> </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>cat (concatenate)</h3>
<p>The command cat can be used to display the contents of a file 
  on the screen. Type: </p>
<p class="cli"> $ cat newFile </p>
<p align="center"><img class="screenshot" src="P2/cat.png" alt="Linux Terminal - using the cat command" /> </p>
<p> As you can see, the message that was written to the file with the vim editor is now being displayed to the terminal.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>less</h3>
<p>The command less writes the contents of a file onto the screen 
  a page at a time. Type </p>
<p class="cli"> $ less longFile </p>
<p align="center"><img class="screenshot" src="P2/less.png" alt="Linux Terminal - using the less command" /> </p>
<p align="center"><img class="screenshot" src="P2/less-disp.png" alt="Linux Terminal - display of less command" /> </p>
<p> Press the [<b>space-bar</b>] if you want to see another page, and type [<b>q</b>] 
  if you want to quit reading. As you can see, 
    <span class="command">less</span> is used in preference 
  to <span class="command">cat</span> for longer files. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>head</h3>
<p>The <span class="command">head</span> command writes the first ten lines of a file to the screen. </p>
<p> First clear the screen then type </p>
<p class="cli"> $ head longFile </p>
<p> Then type </p>
<p class="cli"> $ head -5 longFile </p>
<p align="center"><img class="screenshot" src="P2/head.png" alt="Linux Terminal - using the head command" /> </p>
<p> What difference did the -5 do to the head command? </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>tail</h3>
<p>The <span class="command">tail</span> command writes the last ten lines of a file to the screen. </p>
<p> Clear the screen and type </p>
<p class="cli"> $ tail longFile </p>
<p> A tag with a number can be used here just as it was with the head command, try it out!</p>
<p align="center"><img class="screenshot" src="P2/tail.png" alt="Linux Terminal - using the tail command" /> </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="subheader">2.3 Copying Files</h2>
<h3>cp (copy)</h3>
<p> <span class="command">cp <i>file1 file2</i></span> is the command which makes a copy of <strong>file1</strong> in the current working directory and calls it <strong>file2</strong> </p>
<p> What we are going to do now is create a copy of the file newFile which we made with the touch command</p>
<p> First, <span class="command">cd</span> to your <b>linuxstuff</b> directory.</p>
<p class="cli"> $ cd ~/linuxstuff</p>
<p> Then at the Linux prompt, type, </p>
<p class="cli"> $ cp newFile copyFile </p>
<p> The above command means copy the file <strong>newFile</strong> to a new file called <strong>copyFile</strong> </p>
<p align="center"><img class="screenshot" src="P2/cp.png" alt="Linux Terminal - using the cp command" /> </p>
<!--<h3>Exercise 2a</h3>
<p>Create a backup of your <strong>science.txt</strong> file by copying it to 
  a file called <strong>science.bak</strong> </p>-->

<h2 class="subheader">2.4 Moving files</h2>
<h3>mv (move)</h3>
<p><span class="command">mv <i>file1 file2</i></span></command> 
moves (or renames) <strong>file1</strong> 
  to <strong>file2</strong> </p>
<p> To move a file from one place to another, use the mv command. 
  This has the effect of moving rather than copying the file, so you end up with 
  only one file rather than two. </p>
<p> It can also be used to rename a file, by moving the file to the same directory, 
  but giving it a different name. </p>
<p> We are now going to move the file copyFile to your backups directory. </p>
<p>First, change directories to your linuxstuff directory (can you remember how?). 
  Then, inside the <strong>linuxstuff</strong> directory, type</p>
<p class="cli"> $ mv copyFile backups</p>
<p> View the contents of the linuxstuff and backups directories to confirm that the command worked.</p>
<p align="center"><img class="screenshot" src="P2/mv.png" alt="Linux Terminal - using the mv command" /> </p>

<h2 class="subheader">2.5 Removing files and directories </h2>
<h3>rm (remove), rmdir (remove directory)</h3>
<p>To delete (remove) a file, use the <span class="command">rm</span> command. As an example, 
  we are going to delete the original file we created, newFile.</p>
<p> Inside your <strong>linuxstuff</strong> directory, type</p>
<p class="cli"> $ ls<br />
  $ rm newFile<br />
  $ ls </p>
<p align="center"><img class="screenshot" src="P2/rm.png" alt="Linux Terminal - using the rm command" /> </p>
<p> You can use the <span class="command">rmdir</span> command to remove a directory (make sure 
  it is empty first).</p>
  <p>Try to remove the <strong>backups</strong> directory. You 
  will not be able to since Linux will not let you remove a non-empty directory.</p>
  <p>In order to delete <strong>backups</strong>, navigate into it and delete copyFile, which is located there. Then return to <strong>linuxstuff</strong> and try rmdir again.</p>
<p align="center"><img class="screenshot" src="P2/rmdir.png" alt="Linux Terminal - using the rmdir command" /> </p>
<!--<h3>Exercise 2b</h3>
<p>Create a directory called <strong>tempstuff</strong> using <span class="command">mkdir</span> , then remove it using the <span class="command">rmdir</span> command.</p>-->

<h2 class="subheader">2.6 Searching the contents of a file </h2>
<h3>Simple searching using less</h3>
<p>Using <span class="command">less</span>, you can search though a text file for a keyword (pattern). 
  For example, to search through <strong>longFile</strong> for the word lines containing the number <b>3</b>, 
  type </p>
<p class="cli"> $ less longFile </p>
<p> then, still in <span class="command">less</span>,  type a forward 
  slash [<b>/</b>] followed by the word (or in this case, number) to search</p>
<p class="cli"> /3</p>
<p align="center"><img class="screenshot" src="P2/less-search.png" alt="Linux Terminal - using the less command to search" /> </p>
<p> As you can see, <span class="command">less</span> finds and highlights the keyword (3). Type [<b>n</b>] 
  to search for the next occurrence of the number. </p>
<p>Naturally, this search function works on any words as well, similar to a keystroke you may be familiar with, CTRL+F.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>grep (don't ask why it is called grep)</h3>
<p><span class="command">grep</span> is one of many standard Linux utilities. It searches files 
  for specified words or patterns. First clear the screen, then type </p>
<p class="cli"> $ grep 4 longFile </p>
<p align="center"><img class="screenshot" src="P2/grep.png" alt="Linux Terminal - using the grep command" /> </p>
<p> As you can see, <span class="command">grep</span> has printed out each line containg the number 
  <b>4</b>. </p>
<p> While grep works just as well on words, keep in mind that it is case sensitive; it distinguishes between 
  upper and lower case characters. </p>
<p> To ignore upper/lower case distinctions, use the -i option, i.e. type </p>
<p class="cli"> $ grep -i word fileName </p>
<p> To search for a phrase or pattern, you must enclose it in single quotes (the 
  apostrophe symbol). For example to search for spinning top, type </p>
<p class="cli"> $ grep -i 'spinning top' fileName </p>
<p> Some of the other options of grep are: </p>
<p> <b>-v </b>display those lines that do NOT match <br />
  <b>-n</b> precede each matching line with the line number <br />
  <b>-c </b>print only the total count of matched lines <br />
</p>
<p> Try some of them and see the different results. Don't forget, you can use 
  more than one option at a time. See below screenshots for some examples:</p>
<p align="center"><img class="screenshot" src="P2/grep-c.png" alt="Linux Terminal - using the grep -c command" /> </p>
<p align="center"><img class="screenshot" src="P2/grep-v-n.png" alt="Linux Terminal - using the grep -v -n command" /> </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>wc (word count)</h3>
<p>A handy little utility is the <span class="command">wc</span></samp> command, short for word count. 
  To do a word count on <strong>longFile</strong>, type </p>
<p class="cli"> $ wc -w longFile </p>
<p> To find out how many lines the file has, type </p>
<p class="cli"> $ wc -l longFile </p>
<p align="center"><img class="screenshot" src="P2/wc-w-l.png" alt="Linux Terminal - using the wc command" /> </p>
