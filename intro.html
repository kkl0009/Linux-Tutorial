  <h1>Linux Introduction </h1>
  <h2 class="subheader">What is Linux? </h2>
  <p>Linux is an  operating system which was first developed in the mid-1990s, and has been under constant development ever since. By operating 
  system, we mean the suite of programs which make the computer work. It is a stable, multi-user, multi-tasking system for servers, desktops and laptops. </p>
  <p> Linux systems also have a graphical user interface (GUI) similar to Microsoft Windows which provides an easy to use environment. However, knowledge of Linux is required for operations 
  which aren't covered by a graphical program, or for when there is no Windows 
  interface available, for example, in a telnet session.</p>
  <h2  class="subheader">Types of Linux</h2>
  <p>There are many different versions of Linux, although they share common similarities. Some of the  most popular varieties of Linux are  CentOS, Red Hat, Kali, Fedora, and Ubuntu (which will be used in this tutorial). </p>
  <h2 class="subheader">The Linux operating system </h2>
<p>The Linux operating system is made up of three parts; the kernel, the shell 
  and the programs. </p>
<h3>The kernel </h3>
<p>The kernel of Linux is the hub of the operating system: it allocates time and 
  memory to programs and handles the filestore and communications in response 
  to system calls. </p>
<p> As an illustration of the way that the shell and the kernel work together, 
  suppose a user types <span class="command">rm myfile</span> (which has the effect of removing 
  the file <strong>myfile</strong>). The shell searches the filestore for the 
  file containing the program <span class="command">rm</span>, and then requests the kernel, through 
  system calls, to execute the program <span class="command">rm</span> on <b>myfile</b>. When the process 
  <span class="command">rm myfile</span> has finished running, the shell then returns the Linux 
  prompt $ to the user, indicating that it is waiting for further commands. </p>
<h3>The shell</h3>
<p>The shell acts as an interface between the user and the kernel. When a user 
  logs in, the login program checks the username and password, and then starts 
  another program called the shell. The shell is a command line interpreter (CLI). 
  It interprets the commands the user types in and arranges for them to be carried 
  out. The commands are themselves programs: when they terminate, the shell gives 
  the user another prompt ($ on Ubuntu). </p>
<p> The adept user can customise his/her own shell, and users can use different 
  shells on the same machine. Staff and students in the school have the <b>tcsh shell</b>  by default. </p>
<p> The tcsh shell has certain features to help the user inputting commands.</p>
<p> Filename Completion - By typing part of the name of a command, filename or 
  directory and pressing the [<b>Tab</b>] key, the tcsh shell will complete the rest 
  of the name automatically. If the shell finds more than one name beginning with 
  those letters you have typed, it will beep, prompting you to type a few more 
  letters before pressing the tab key again. </p>
<p> History - The shell keeps a list of the commands you have typed in. If you 
  need to repeat a command, use the cursor keys to scroll up and down the list 
  or type history for a list of previous commands. </p>
    
<p> </p>
<h2 class="subheader">Files and processes </h2>
<p>Everything in Linux is either a file or a process. </p>
<p> A process is an executing program identified by a unique PID (process identifier). 
</p>
<p> A file is a collection of data. They are created by users using text editors, 
  running compilers etc. </p>
<p> Examples of files: </p>
<ul>
  <li> a document (report, essay etc.) </li>
  <li> the text of a program written in some high-level programming language </li>
  <li> instructions comprehensible directly to the machine and incomprehensible 
    to a casual user, for example, a collection of binary digits (an executable 
    or binary file); </li>
  <li> a directory, containing information about its contents, which may be a 
    mixture of other directories (subdirectories) and ordinary files. </li>
</ul>
  
<p> </p>
<h2 class="subheader">The Directory Structure </h2>
<p>All the files are grouped together in the directory structure. The file-system 
  is arranged in a hierarchical structure, like an inverted tree. The top of the 
  hierarchy is traditionally called <strong>root</strong> (written as a slash / ) </p>
<p>Any element of this tree (representing a directory in Linux) may have one or more children, called their subdirectories.</p>
<h2  class="subheader">Starting a Linux terminal </h2>
<p>To open a Linux terminal window, click on the &quot;Terminal&quot; icon from Applications/Accessories menus.</p>
<p align="center"><img class="screenshot" src="Intro/Desktop.png"  width="750" height="500"/></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p> A Linux Terminal window will then appear with a  $ prompt, waiting for 
  you to start entering commands.</p>
